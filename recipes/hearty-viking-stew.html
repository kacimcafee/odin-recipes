        <p><font size="5">Hearty and rustic, Vikings relied on this traditional stew 
          to fuel their bodies and souls on harsh winter nights. Bursting with the robust flavors, Viking Stew is traditionally simmered
          in a rich broth of beef, lamb, root vegetables, thyme, and juniper berries. This hearty meals perfectly captures
           the spirit of the Old Norse hearth- simple, nourishing, and sublime on cold nights by the fire.</p>
