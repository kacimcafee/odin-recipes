        <p><font size="5">Thick, creamy, and rich in protein, Skyr is a traditional Icelandic cultured dairy product dating back to Viking times. 
            Similar to yogurt but milder in flavor and denser in texture,it is often enjoyed topped with deliciously ripe berries, nuts, and honey.
            Skyr is both a nutritious staple and a timeless taste of the North.</p>
