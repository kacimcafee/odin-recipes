            <p>Thick, creamy, and rich in protein, skyr is a traditional Icelandic cultured dairy product dating back to Viking times. 
            Similar to yogurt but milder in flavor and denser in texture, it is often enjoyed topped with deliciously ripe berries, nuts, and honey.
            Skyr is both a nutritious staple and a timeless taste of the North.</p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>   
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the full gallon of skim milk, the vanilla bean, and the vanilla bean caviar to a large, stainless steel or enameled pot with a nice, thick, heavy bottom. 
                    Slowly bring the milk to a steady simmer over a medium-high burner, stirring frequently to prevent scalding on the bottom of the pan until it reaches 185째F-190째F; 
                    about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                
                    <li>If it does scald, take care not to stir the scalded bits into the rest of the milk. 
                    As soon as it hits the target temperature, remove the pan from the burner and allow it to cool to 110째F. 
                    Whisk together the Skyr or Siggi's and 1 cup of the 110째F milk until perfectly smooth. 
                    Pour that into the pot and stir until fully incorporated.
                    Use a small whisk to combine the rennet and cool water then immediately stir that into the pot until fully incorporated;
                    about 1 minute. Put the lid onto the pan. Double up a thick bath towel and lay it over the pot. 
                    Put the pot in a warm, draft-free place or simply put it lidded pan into an empty oven with the light on for about 12 hours.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                
                    <li>Now you have options. You can line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth, 
                    use a large nut milk bag, or sew a bag of muslin with straps at the top. 
                    Spoon the skyr curds into whichever of those you choose, removing the vanilla bean as you go. 
                    You do want to spoon and not pour the curd as it is delicate enough that pouring it could break it. 
                    Let the cheesecloth rest int he colander or suspend it and allow it to drip over a bowl. 
                    You want this place to be rather cool, so a mudroom, refrigerator, or cool room is your best choice. 
                    You let this drip for 4 to 8 hours.</li>
                </ol>

        <div class="directions"> 
            <h4>To Store:</h4>
                <p>Transfer to jars or an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks. 
                Sweeten as you serve. You'll be able to re-culture this homemade skyr, 
                but should do so within 2 1/2-3 weeks of it being made for optimal results.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="directions">
            <h4>For Silky Smooth Skyr:</h4>
                <p>Hang onto the whey that drains from it as it thickens. 
                Transfer the skyr to a mixing bowl before jarring it. 
                Beat mercilessly with a hand or stand mixer, 
                dribbling in a tablespoon of whey at a time until it is silky, 
                smooth, and perfect.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="directions">
            <h4>If you want to pre-sweeten this skyr:</h4>
                <p>You can draw off the amount you'll use to reculture it and leave that unsweetened. 
                Sweeten the skyr as you beat it mercilessly in the stand mixer before you add any whey. 
                Then adjust accordingly. Honey and maple syrup are both beautiful choices, but my preference is for dark maple syrup.</p>
