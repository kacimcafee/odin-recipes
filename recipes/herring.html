            <section class="description" aria-label="Recipe Description">
                <p>A staple of Scandinavian cuisine, pickled herring is a tangy, savory delicacy made by curing fresh herring fillets in a brine of vinegar, sugar, onions, and aromatic spices like allspice and bay leaf. 
                The result is a flavorful, slightly sweet fish with a firm texture, often served chilled with rye bread, potatoes, or sour cream. It's a timeless Viking-era preserve that balances tradition, taste, and long shelf life.</p>
