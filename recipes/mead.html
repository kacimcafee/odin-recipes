            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the honey and water over medium heat, stirring until the honey is fully dissolved. Do not boil.</li>
                <li>Allow the honey mixture to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to a sterilized fermenting container.</li>
                <li>Add the yeast and any additional flavorings, such as raisins or citrus zest. Seal the fermenting container with an airlock.</li>
                <li>Allow the mead to ferment for 2-4 weeks, or until the bubbling in the airlock slows down.</li>
                <li>Rack the mead into a secondary fermenting container, leaving any sediment behind.</li>
                <li>Allow the mead to age for an additional 2-6 months, or until it reaches your desired flavor and clarity.</li>
                <li>Bottle and enjoy chilled from a Viking Horn.</li>
