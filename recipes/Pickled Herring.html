        <p><font size="5"> A staple of Scandinavian cuisine, Pickled Herring is a tangy, savory delicacy made by curing fresh herring fillets in a brine of vinegar, sugar, onions, and aromatic spices like allspice and bay leaf. 
            The result is a flavorful, slightly sweet fish with a firm texture, often served chilled with rye bread, potatoes, or sour cream. It's a timeless Viking-era preserve that balances tradition, taste, and long shelf life.</p>
