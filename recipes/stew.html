      <section class="description" aria-label="Recipe Description">
        <p>Wholesome and rustic, Vikings relied on this traditional stew 
        to fuel their bodies and souls on harsh winter nights. Bursting with the robust flavors, viking stew is traditionally simmered
        in a rich broth of beef, lamb, root vegetables, thyme, and juniper berries. This hearty meal perfectly captures
        the spirit of the Old Norse hearth- simple, nourishing, and sublime on cold nights by the fire.</p>
