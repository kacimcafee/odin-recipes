## Hearty Viking Stew Recipe

    1 teaspoon dried thyme

    1 teaspoon ground coriander

## Pickled Herring Recipe
> **Source:** [Swedish Pickled Herring](https://honest-food.net/swedish-pickled-herring/)

# Ingredients:
* 

    1/4 cup kosher salt
    5 cups water, divided
    1 pound herring fillets
    2 cups distilled or white wine vinegar
    1/4 cup sugar
    1 teaspoon mustard seed
    2 teaspoons whole allspice
    2 teaspoons black peppercorns
    3 bay leaves
    3 cloves
    1 lemon, thinly sliced
    1 medium red onion thinly sliced


# Instructions:
* 

     Heat 4 cups of water enough to dissolve salt. Let this brine cool to room temperature. When it does, submerge the herring fillets in the brine and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours. Meanwhile, bring the sugar, vinegar, the remaining cup of water and all the spices to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and let this steep until cool.
        
     When the herring have brined, layer them in a glass jar with the sliced lemon and red onion. Divide the spices between your containers if you are using more than one. Pour over the cooled pickling liquid and seal the jars. Wait at least a day before eating. Store in the fridge for up to 1 month.



## Skyr with Nuts and Honey Recipe
> **Source:** [Icelandic Yogurt - How to Make Skyr](https://www.foodiewithfamily.com/icelandic-yogurt/)


# Ingredients:
* 

    1 gallon skim milk
    1 vanilla bean slit lengthwise, caviar scraped
    2/3 cup Siggi's" plain or vanilla skyr
    4 drops liquid vegetable rennet or 2 drops double strength rennet
    1/4 cup cool non-chlorinated water



# Instructions:
* 

    Add the full gallon of skim milk, the vanilla bean, and the vanilla bean caviar to a large, stainless steel or enameled pot with a nice, thick, heavy bottom. Slowly bring the milk to a steady simmer over a medium-high burner, stirring frequently to prevent scalding on the bottom of the pan until it reaches 185°F-190°F; about 15 to 20 minutes.

    If it does scald, take care not to stir the scalded bits into the rest of the milk. As soon as it hits the target temperature, remove the pan from the burner and allow it to cool to 110°F. Whisk together the Skyr or Siggi's and 1 cup of the 110°F milk until perfectly smooth. Pour that into the pot and stir until fully incorporated.
    Use a small whisk to combine the rennet and cool water then immediately stir that into the pot until fully incorporated; about 1 minute. Put the lid onto the pan. Double up a thick bath towel and lay it over the pot. Put the pot in a warm, draft-free place or simply put it lidded pan into an empty oven with the light on for about 12 hours.
    
    Now you have options. You can line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth, use a large nut milk bag, or sew a bag of muslin with straps at the top. Spoon the skyr curds into whichever of those you choose, removing the vanilla bean as you go. You do want to spoon and not pour the curd as it is delicate enough that pouring it could break it. Let the cheesecloth rest int he colander or suspend it and allow it to drip over a bowl. You want this place to be rather cool, so a mudroom, refrigerator, or cool room is your best choice. You let this drip for 4 to 8 hours.

    To Store:

    Transfer to jars or an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks. Sweeten as you serve**. You'll be able to re-culture this homemade skyr, but should do so within 2 1/2-3 weeks of it being made for optimal results.
    
    For silky smooth skyr:

    Hang onto the whey that drains from it as it thickens. Transfer the skyr to a mixing bowl before jarring it. Beat mercilessly with a hand or stand mixer, dribbling in a tablespoon of whey at a time until it is silky, smooth, and perfect.
    
    If you want to pre-sweeten this skyr:

    You can draw off the amount you'll use to reculture it and leave that unsweetened. Sweeten the skyr as you beat it mercilessly in the stand mixer before you add any whey. Then adjust accordingly. Honey and maple syrup are both beautiful choices, but my preference is for dark maple syrup. 



## Sweet Rolls
> **Source:** [Skyrim - Sweet Roll](https://www.level1chef.com/skyrim-sweetroll/)

# Ingredients:
* 
    Dough:
    AP Flour 1 1/2 cups
    Salt 1/2 tsp
    Whole Milk 	1 cup + 1 cup
    Eggs 	3 each
    Butter (melted) 6 TBSP (3oz)
    Vegetable Oil as needed

    Icing:
    Confectioner’s Sugar 2 cups
    Water 2 TBSP
    Vanilla Extract 1/4 tsp

# Instructions:
* 
    Dough:
    In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt, and whisk them to combine.
    
    Whisk together the 3 eggs and 1 cup of the milk; mix this into the flour until no lumps remain, and the batter is smooth. 
   
    Slowly pour in the remaining cup of milk along with the melted butter, while continually whisking until completely combined (the batter will be extremely liquidy). Leave the bowl out on the counter for about 30 minutes so that the ingredients can warm up to room temperature. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 500F.
    
    Place the mini bundt pan in the oven for a few minutes to heat up, then transfer your batter into a liquid measuring cup for easy pouring. Have a little vegetable oil, and a pastry brush handy too, as the next step should be performed as quickly as possible.
   
    Using oven mitts, or kitchen towels, quickly open the oven door and slide out the now hot bundt pan. Use the pastry brush to coat the insides with a thin layer of oil and then pour the popover batter into each of the outside moulds, all the way to the top. Carefully slide the pan back into the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. Resist the urge to open the oven door again before then. 
    
    After 30 minutes, open the door and check the popovers. We’re looking for a nice golden brown and hard, crispy top. Once achieved, you can reduce the oven temperature to 300F and let them bake for 10 more minutes before pulling them out (if after the initial 30 minutes the tops are soft and depress easily when touched, close the door and let them bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes at 500F before dropping the oven temperature to 300F).
    
    Remove the pan from the oven and ‘pop’ out the pastries immediately, being very careful not to burn your fingers in the process (stuff is hot!). The oil we brushed on earlier should help the Sweetrolls release easily from the pan. Flip them upside down and press on them gently to help them sit flat.
            
    Icing:
    Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.
    Lightly glaze sweet rolls once they have cooled enough. Now no lollygagging; enjoy fresh!

# Ingredients:
* 
    1 lb fresh salmon fillet, skin on
    1/4 cup salt
    1/4 cup sugar
    2 tbsp crushed black pepper
    1 large bunch fresh dill

# Instructions:
* 
    
    In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and crushed black pepper.
    Spread half of the dill on a large piece of plastic wrap. Place the salmon fillet skin-side down on the dill, and then cover the fillet with the salt mixture. 3. Top the salmon with the remaining dill and wrap the plastic wrap tightly around the fillet.

    Place the wrapped salmon on a tray or dish and refrigerate for 48-72 hours, turning the fillet every 12 hours to ensure even curing.
    After curing, remove the salmon from the plastic wrap and gently scrape off the dill and curing mixture.
    Thinly slice the gravlax and serve on rye bread or crispbread with a dollop of mustard sauce.

# Ingredients:
*     
    4 large apples
    1 cup sugar
    1/2 cup water
    1/2 cup heavy cream
    1/4 cup salted butter
    1 tsp sea salt

# Instructions:
*   
    Core the apples and cut them into wedges.
    
    In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook, without stirring, until the mixture turns a golden caramel color.
    
    Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully stir in the heavy cream, salted butter, and sea salt. The mixture will bubble up, so be cautious.
   
    Return the saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the caramel is smooth and all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
    
    Allow the caramel to cool slightly, then drizzle it over the apple wedges or serve it as a dipping sauce.
