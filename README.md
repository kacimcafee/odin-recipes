    4 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder roast, cut into 2- to 3-inch chunks

    3 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste

    1/4 cup honey

    1 cup fresh blackberries, or other fresh berries

    2 tablespoons lingonberry jam

    6 cups cold water

    3 cloves garlic, peeled

    1 teaspoon dried thyme

    1 teaspoon ground coriander

    1 yellow onion, cut into large dice

    2 leeks, washed thoroughly, cut into 1-inch pieces

    10 large brown mushrooms, halved

    1 small green cabbage, cut into 1-inch pieces

    3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces

    1/4 cup torn cilantro leaves

    1/4 cup chopped fresh dill

    2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves


#### Instructions:
* 

    While stew is coming to a boil, add garlic, dry thyme, and ground coriander. When mixture comes to a rolling boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    
    Stir in onion, leeks, and mushrooms, and simmer until meat is almost, but not quite fork tender,  about 45 minutes more.
    
    Stir in cabbage, carrots, and fennel; continue to simmer until vegetables and meat are very tender, about 30 minutes. 
    
    Season to taste with salt. Serve with fresh herbs scattered over the top.



### Pickled Herring Recipe
> **Source:** [Swedish Pickled Herring](https://honest-food.net/swedish-pickled-herring/)

#### Ingredients:
* 

    1/4 cup kosher salt
    5 cups water, divided
    1 pound herring fillets
    2 cups distilled or white wine vinegar
    1/4 cup sugar
    1 teaspoon mustard seed
    2 teaspoons whole allspice
    2 teaspoons black peppercorns
    3 bay leaves
    3 cloves
    1 lemon, thinly sliced
    1 medium red onion thinly sliced


#### Instructions:
* 

     Heat 4 cups of water enough to dissolve salt. Let this brine cool to room temperature. When it does, submerge the herring fillets in the brine and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours. Meanwhile, bring the sugar, vinegar, the remaining cup of water and all the spices to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and let this steep until cool.
        
     When the herring have brined, layer them in a glass jar with the sliced lemon and red onion. Divide the spices between your containers if you are using more than one. Pour over the cooled pickling liquid and seal the jars. Wait at least a day before eating. Store in the fridge for up to 1 month.




### Skyr with Nuts and Honey Recipe
> **Source:** [Icelandic Yogurt - How to Make Skyr](https://www.foodiewithfamily.com/icelandic-yogurt/)

#### Ingredients:
* 

    1 gallon skim milk
    1 vanilla bean slit lengthwise, caviar scraped
    2/3 cup Siggi's" plain or vanilla skyr
    4 drops liquid vegetable rennet or 2 drops double strength rennet
    1/4 cup cool non-chlorinated water



#### Instructions:
* 

    Add the full gallon of skim milk, the vanilla bean, and the vanilla bean caviar to a large, stainless steel or enameled pot with a nice, thick, heavy bottom. Slowly bring the milk to a steady simmer over a medium-high burner, stirring frequently to prevent scalding on the bottom of the pan until it reaches 185째F-190째F; about 15 to 20 minutes.

    If it does scald, take care not to stir the scalded bits into the rest of the milk. As soon as it hits the target temperature, remove the pan from the burner and allow it to cool to 110째F. Whisk together the Skyr or Siggi's and 1 cup of the 110째F milk until perfectly smooth. Pour that into the pot and stir until fully incorporated.
    Use a small whisk to combine the rennet and cool water then immediately stir that into the pot until fully incorporated; about 1 minute. Put the lid onto the pan. Double up a thick bath towel and lay it over the pot. Put the pot in a warm, draft-free place or simply put it lidded pan into an empty oven with the light on for about 12 hours.
    
    Now you have options. You can line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth, use a large nut milk bag, or sew a bag of muslin with straps at the top. Spoon the skyr curds into whichever of those you choose, removing the vanilla bean as you go. You do want to spoon and not pour the curd as it is delicate enough that pouring it could break it. Let the cheesecloth rest int he colander or suspend it and allow it to drip over a bowl. You want this place to be rather cool, so a mudroom, refrigerator, or cool room is your best choice. You let this drip for 4 to 8 hours.

    To Store:

    Transfer to jars or an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks. Sweeten as you serve**. You'll be able to re-culture this homemade skyr, but should do so within 2 1/2-3 weeks of it being made for optimal results.
    
    For silky smooth skyr:

    Hang onto the whey that drains from it as it thickens. Transfer the skyr to a mixing bowl before jarring it. Beat mercilessly with a hand or stand mixer, dribbling in a tablespoon of whey at a time until it is silky, smooth, and perfect.
    
    If you want to pre-sweeten this skyr:

    You can draw off the amount you'll use to reculture it and leave that unsweetened. Sweeten the skyr as you beat it mercilessly in the stand mixer before you add any whey. Then adjust accordingly. Honey and maple syrup are both beautiful choices, but my preference is for dark maple syrup.
